## 📘 Project Overview

**Earthquake Visualizer** is a web application designed for **Casey**, a geography student, who wants to visualize recent earthquake activity around the world and understand seismic patterns.  
The app fetches real-time earthquake data using the **USGS Earthquake API** and plots it on an **interactive map** using **React Leaflet**.

This project demonstrates:
- Understanding and interpreting user requirements.
- Building a responsive, data-driven, and user-friendly web app.
- Integration of third-party APIs and visualization libraries.
- Clean and maintainable React code architecture.
